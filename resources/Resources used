	General code

			This has been invaluable throughout the project
			
	Gun guide
		gunlabs.blogspot.co.uk
			The tutorials here were used for the guns. These need re-doing for the next version
			but the guides themselves were incredibly useful
			
    Guns in general - see the ones listed under graphics below. I think I changed out the code, but some may still have been used

	Particle based trees
		http://www.prodigal-game.com/
			Trisk was super kind to let us use his tree idea and build on it, even letting us use the sprites for it
			Thanks so much for this! - we still need to go back to this and put in more grass and different types of 
			trees.  The island was a real inspiration seeing just how great this could look (and giving a base reference
			for how much of a cpu hit this would take)
			
	Various voxels
		Burktross (DoomZ)
			Created for this project we have team member Burktross' contributions. From shelves, tanks, lockers and more, these
			are really fantastic and are much appreciated. Thanks again Burktross!
		
	textures used for a large amount of the floor and road ones from alpha 14. These look great, and forced me to learn to tile
	textures, so, thanks for that!

Description             : This is a pack of static decorative voxel vehicles for ZDoom and   				 	  GZDoom. Guaranteed to to give some life to your maps! 

				  Instructions: Since voxel model collisions are handled like sprite 					  collisions, only the very center parts of the vehicles are solid 					  initially. You have to provide additional collision areas with bridge 				  things. To see how they are laid out on each vehicle, see the 						  demonstration level. If you want to remove the demonstration level, just 				  remove the maps directory from the PK3 file. The vehicles occupy DoomEd 				  numbers 10600 through 10803.
